# Data heterogeneity

## Background

In federated learning, the main challenge is that clients have heterogeneity among their local data distributions, which will cause inconsistency of local model optimization of various clients, and lead to poor accuracy of global models and not even convergence. Therefore, we introduced some algorithms to deal with this problem. In this directory, we introduced the relevant algorithm theory and usage, as well as experimental effects.
